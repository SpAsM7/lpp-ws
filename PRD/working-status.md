# Working Status

### 6. Testing
- [ ] Unit Tests
  - Need tests for all auth actions
  - Need tests for protection logic
- [ ] Integration Tests
  - Need E2E tests for auth flows
  - Need error scenario coverage

### 4. Newly Identified Cleanup Items (2025-01-07)

#### Redundant Files to Remove
- [x] `app/auth/confirm/route.ts` - Redundant with `/api/auth/callback/route.ts`
- [âœ“] `src/lib/actions/auth/verify-email.ts` - Keeping this file as it's actively used
- [x] Custom email verification templates in `supabase/templates/` - Not present in codebase
- [x] `getSession()` helper in `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` - Removed in favor of `getUser()`

#### Type System Cleanup
- [x] Remove `UserSession` type from `src/types/supabase.ts` - Removed in favor of Supabase's built-in types
- [x] Clean up unused auth-related types from client-side implementation - Removed redundant types and improved type safety
- [x] Update type imports to use Supabase's built-in types
- [x] Remove any custom session types

#### Environment Variable Cleanup
- [x] Audit and remove unused auth-related environment variables
- [x] Verify only required Supabase variables remain:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

#### Auth Actions Refinement
- [x] Simplify `create-reset-request.ts` to use standard Supabase flow
- [x] Remove custom session handling from all auth actions
- [x] Update error handling to use Supabase's standard messages
- [ ] Remove any redundant error mapping

#### Middleware Optimization
- [x] Simplify auth checks in middleware - Already using simple Supabase patterns
- [x] Remove custom session refresh logic - Using standard Supabase session handling
- [x] Update to consistently use `getUser()` - Already implemented
- [x] Remove unnecessary cookie handling complexity - Using minimal required cookie handling

#### Component Refinement
- [x] Remove client-side auth state management - Removed session provider in favor of server-side auth
- [x] Simplify form components to use Supabase flows
- [x] Update error handling to use standard messages
- [x] Remove unnecessary loading states

#### Error Handling Consolidation
- [ ] Review and update `src/lib/errors/auth.ts`
- [ ] Remove custom error messages in favor of Supabase's
- [ ] Consolidate error handling patterns
- [ ] Remove redundant error transformations

### Next Steps

#### Immediate Priority
1. Remove redundant files and code
2. Clean up type system
3. Simplify middleware
4. Update error handling

#### Upcoming
1. Complete error recovery flows
2. Add comprehensive testing
3. Implement role-based access
4. Refine component implementations

#### Blocked Items
- None currently

## Notes
